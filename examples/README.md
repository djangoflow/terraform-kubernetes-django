# Django Application Kubernetes Deployment Example

This example demonstrates the practical use of the Terraform module designed to deploy a Django application within a Kubernetes environment, fully leveraging cloud services for an optimized infrastructure setup. By following this example, users will learn how to configure a robust and scalable deployment that integrates seamlessly with AWS, Google Cloud, and Cloudflare, ensuring the application benefits from high availability, security, and performance.

The deployment covers not only the creation of a Kubernetes cluster but also the setup of necessary cloud resources, networking configurations, and security measures to provide a comprehensive infrastructure solution for Django applications.

## Features Demonstrated:

- **Kubernetes Cluster Deployment**: Showcases how to set up and configure a Kubernetes cluster specifically for Django applications.
- **Cloud Services Integration**: Details the integration with AWS and Google Cloud for provisioning compute instances, storage solutions, and other essential resources.
- **Networking and Security with Cloudflare**: Illustrates how to configure Cloudflare for enhanced security features, including DDoS protection, and CDN services for improved application delivery.
- **Comprehensive Environment Setup**: Provides insights into configuring environment variables, managing secrets, and setting up service accounts with appropriate permissions for accessing cloud resources.

This example serves as a blueprint for deploying Django applications with a focus on scalability, security, and performance, utilizing the best practices in cloud infrastructure management.

## Usage

To run this example, you need to execute:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Note: This example will create resources. Resources cost money. Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need these resources.
